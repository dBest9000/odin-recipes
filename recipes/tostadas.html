        <h4>The Best Vegan Tostadas</h4>
        <p>Toppings can be changed according to your personal tastes. My family likes to first spoon a dollop of beans onto the tortilla and spread it out,
            then top with chopped tomatoes, green onions, black olives, avocado, lettuce, taco sauce, and chunky salsa. 
            My family usually eats 2 per person, but we sometimes eat 3. Have extra tortillas on hand in case someone is extra hungry.

        <h5>Ingredents</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1(28 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded vegan Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped avocado</li>
            <li>1 cup vegan sour cream</li>
            <li>6 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced black olives</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat refried beans in a pot over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, 3 to 5 minutes. Place in a serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry 1 tortilla until crispy and slightly browned, 10 to 30 seconds per side; be careful not to burn. Place on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining tortillas, adding more oil as needed and stacking with paper towels in between to soak excess oil.</li>
            <li>Put cheese, lettuce, avocado, sour cream, green onions, tomatoes, and olives in separate small bowls with spoons for serving. Let everyone prepare their own tostada to taste.</li>
        </ol>
